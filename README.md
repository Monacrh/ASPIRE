## Problem Statement

Students struggle to make informed decisions about their academic and career pathways due 
to lack of personalized guidance. Specifically: 
- Students cannot systematically identify their academic strengths and weaknesses from 
their historical performance data 
- There is no data-driven mechanism to match students' academic profiles with suitable 
career paths based on real industry requirements 
- Students lack intelligent, personalized course recommendations that align with their 
career goals and academic capabilities 
- Current academic planning approaches do not strategically connect course selection 
with long-term career objectives 
- This results in suboptimal decision-making, inefficient academic planning, and 
potential misalignment between educational choices and professional aspirations

## Objective
Develop an AI-based academic recommendation system with three integrated modules 
(automated parsing, LLM career matching, and intelligent course recommendations). 
Specific Objectives 
1. Automated Academic History Parsing 
- Build an automated parsing module by 
- Automatically extracting transcript data (GPA, course grades, and performance 
trends) 
- Identifying each student's academic strengths and weaknesses 
2. LLM-Based Personalized Career Matching 
- Matching academic profiles with career paths based on industry date 
- Providing personalized explanations with confidence 
3. Intelligent Course Recommendation System 
- Suggesting course skills aligned with career goals 
- Providing justification based on a gap analysis between current skills and target 
careers
