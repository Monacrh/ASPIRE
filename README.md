## Problem Statement

Students struggle to make informed decisions about their academic and career pathways due 
to lack of personalized guidance. Specifically: 
- Students cannot systematically identify their academic strengths and weaknesses from 
their historical performance data 
- There is no data-driven mechanism to match students' academic profiles with suitable 
career paths based on real industry requirements 
- Students lack intelligent, personalized course recommendations that align with their 
career goals and academic capabilities 
- Current academic planning approaches do not strategically connect course selection 
with long-term career objectives 
- This results in suboptimal decision-making, inefficient academic planning, and 
potential misalignment between educational choices and professional aspirations
